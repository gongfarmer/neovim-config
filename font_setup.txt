# Font setup on MacOs for iterm2 3.5
Must install the nerd-font version of your desired font so that those little icons will be avialable for use by neovim.
Neovim uses fonts in its status line and also in the defx file manager to show file types (eg. little red ruby next to ruby files.)

It may also be necessary to install the powerline version of the font.
Powerline is a family of vim / neovim status line plugins, which seems to have its own specially patched fonts.
Both are available in brew so I installed both.

  $ brew search inconsolata
  font-inconsolata-for-powerline
  font-inconsolata-go-nerd-font
  font-inconsolata-nerd-font
  
  $ brew install font-inconsolata-for-powerline font-inconsolata-go-nerd-font font-inconsolata-nerd-font

MacOS fonts are installed in your homedir at ~/Library/Fonts.

Next check your font settings in Iterm2.
Preferences->Profiles->Default->Text
Select your font in the Font combo box.
Uncheck "Use a different font for non-ASCII text"


# Font setup on linux

1. Install fonts
For the VED environment, make sure you install the fonts in your jumphost, not on your dev vm.

You can install basic fonts from debian packages:
  sudo apt install fonts-inconsolata
However this is not the nerd version so it lacks the extra glyphs you want for neovim.

I don't see any fancy font installer for ubuntu /debian so it seems like the standard way to install fonts is this:

 * download the fonts you want from https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads
 * install them in ~/.local/share/fonts.
This can be done with wget or curl, see examples on the page above.


2. Configure fonts
In gnome-terminal 3.18.3, select Edit->Profile Prefences.
Select a nerd font.
